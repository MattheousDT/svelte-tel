## Motivation and Goals

I needed a library that would perform some basic frontend formatting of phone numbers (properly validated on the backend) but I didn't want to have to ship a massive library like `libphonenumber-js` to the client just for this luxury. I just needed something that would be "good enough".

The library is fully headless, so you can use it however you want. All logic _should_ be handled by the library, and the UI to be handled by you. This way, you can have full control over the look and feel of your phone input. I also want to make it entirely based on Runes so you get the full power of Svelte.

Future things I'm considering:

- Using an already existing library that doesn't use `libphonenumber-js` under the hood. (or succumbing to the fact that I'll have to use it)
- Internationalization support.
- More options for the class.
- Pre-built components.

If you have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue and we can discuss it.

## Installation

```bash
npm install svelte-tel
```

## Usage

```svelte
<script>
  import { Tel } from "svelte-tel";

  // Initialize the class
  const tel = new Tel();
</script>

<!-- Bind the value to the input -->
<input type="tel" bind:value={tel.value} />

<!-- Now you can access the country data and the raw phone number -->

<p>Country: {tel.countryData.name}</p>
<p>Country Code: {tel.countryData.code}</p>
<p>Phone Number: {tel.value}</p>
<p>Raw Phone Number: {tel.rawValue}</p>
```

üéâ That's literally it üéâ

## More complex example

Now you can use `tel` to do whatever you want.
Here's an example of how you might create a phone input with a country selector.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Tel } from "svelte-tel";
  import { getFlagEmoji } from "path-to-your-flag-emoji-function";

  let input: HTMLInputElement;

  const tel = new Tel({ defaultCountry: "gb" });
</script>

<label>
  Phone number
  <div>
    <select
      bind:value={tel.country}
      onchange={() => {
        // Focus the input when the country is selected
        input?.focus();
      }}
    >
      <option value={null} disabled>‚ùìÔ∏è Select a country</option>
      {#each tel.countries as country}
        <option value={country.code}>
          {getFlagEmoji(country.code)}
          {country.name}
        </option>
      {/each}
    </select>
    <input type="tel" bind:this={input} bind:value={tel.value} />
  </div>
</label>
```

## Options

```svelte
<script>
  import { Tel } from "svelte-tel";

  const tel = new Tel({
    // Default data
    defaultCountry: "US",
    // Note: defaultValue takes precedence over the defaultCountry
    defaultValue: "1234567890",

    // Exclude countries/regions
    excludeCountries: ["CA", "MX"],
    excludeRegions: ["africa"],
    excludeSubregions: ["eu"],

    // Include territories like Jersey, Cayman Islands, etc.
    includeTerritories: true,
  });
</script>

<!-- All options are $state() runes, so you can bind or change them after initialization -->
<input type="checkbox" bind:checked={tel.includeTerritories} />
```

## Contributing

I'm open to contributions, but I'm not sure how much more I want to add to this library. If you have a feature request, feel free to open an issue and we can discuss it. If you see a bug (most likely you will), please open an issue or a PR and I'll take a look.
